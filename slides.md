<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 2) -> So, what exactly is DynamoDB? At its core, it's a NoSQL database provided by AWS. But what makes it special are three key things.
First, its performance. Itâ€™s built to provide incredibly fast, single-digit millisecond response times, even when handling trillions of requests per day.
Second, it's fully managed and serverless. This is a game-changer because it means developers don't have to worry about the underlying hardware, software updates, or scaling. You just create a table and start using it.
And third, it offers a flexible schema. Unlike traditional relational databases, you don't have to define all your columns upfront. This makes it perfect for applications that need to evolve quickly.

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 3) -> Building on that, let's look closer at its characteristics.
On the core side, we've already mentioned its serverless nature and flexible model. A key feature for global applications is Global Tables, which lets you create a single database that is replicated and active in multiple AWS regions at once. This gives users around the world fast, local access to their data. It also supports ACID transactions, which is a feature often associated with relational databases, guaranteeing data correctness.
On the advanced side, DAX, or DynamoDB Accelerator, provides an in-memory cache that can boost read performance from milliseconds to microseconds. And DynamoDB Streams is a powerful feature for building event-driven architectures; it allows you to trigger other processes, like an AWS Lambda function, whenever data in your table changes.

# Backend Access: SDKs & CLI

Interact with DynamoDB from a secure backend using AWS SDKs.

<!-- By adding maxHeight, the code block becomes scrollable if it exceeds the height -->
```python {all|3-4|7-14|17-21|24-29|32-35} {maxHeight: '380px'}
import boto3

# 1. Initialize the DynamoDB resource.
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table('Users')

# 2. Create (or overwrite) an item.
table.put_item(
   Item={
        'user_id': '12345',
        'username': 'johndoe',
        'email': 'johndoe@example.com'
    }
)
```

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 4) -> First, we have the code to create an item.
(CLICK) We start by importing the Boto3 library and initializing our connection to the 'Users' table. This is the setup required for any operation.
(CLICK) Next, we call the `put_item` method. You provide it with a dictionary representing the item you want to save. It's important to know that `put_item` will create the item if it doesn't exist, but it will replace the entire item if it already does.
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Backend Access: Read Item (`get_item`)

To retrieve a single item, we use `table.get_item()`, providing the unique primary key of the item we want. The item's data is found within the `Item` key of the response.

```python
# Read an item.
response = table.get_item(
    Key={
        'user_id': '12345'
    }
)

item = response.get('Item')

# print(item)
# {'user_id': '12345', 'username': 'johndoe', 'email': 'johndoe@example.com'}
```

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 4) -> To read data, we use `get_item`. This is a highly efficient operation. You simply pass the primary key of the item you need, and DynamoDB returns it. The actual data will be inside the 'Item' field of the response.
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Backend Access: Update Item (`update_item`)

The `table.update_item()` method is used to modify specific attributes of an existing item without replacing the whole item. This is more efficient than a `put_item` for partial updates.

```python
# Update an item.
response = table.update_item(
    Key={'user_id': '12345'},
    UpdateExpression='SET #em = :new_email',
    ExpressionAttributeNames={'#em': 'email'},
    ExpressionAttributeValues={':new_email': 'john.doe@newdomain.com'},
    ReturnValues='UPDATED_NEW'
)

# print(response['Attributes'])
# {'email': 'john.doe@newdomain.com'}
```
<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 4) -> For modifying existing data, `update_item` is the best choice. Unlike `put_item`, it only changes the attributes you specify. Here, we're using an `UpdateExpression` to set a new value for the email attribute. This is much more efficient for small changes.
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Backend Access: Delete Item (`delete_item`)

Finally, `table.delete_item()` is used to permanently remove an item from the table. Like `get_item`, it identifies the item to be deleted by its primary key.

```python
# Delete an item.
table.delete_item(
    Key={
        'user_id': '12345'
    }
)
```

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 4) -> And to remove an item, we use the straightforward `delete_item` method, again specifying the item by its primary key. These four operations are the building blocks for any application interacting with DynamoDB.

# Frontend Access: The Secure Architecture

Direct frontend access is insecure. The best practice is to use an API layer.

<div class="w-full h-90 flex items-center justify-center">

<!-- Mermaid diagram styling is now fully handled by style.css -->
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["<div class='flex items-center'><div class='i-carbon-laptop text-3xl mr-2'></div>User's Browser/Mobile App</div>"] -->|HTTPS Request| B(Amazon API Gateway);
    B -->|Triggers| C(AWS Lambda Function);
    C -->|Uses AWS SDK| D["<div class='flex items-center'><div class='i-simple-icons-amazonaws text-3xl mr-2'></div>Amazon DynamoDB</div>"];
    subgraph "Secure AWS Backend"
        B; C; D;
    end
    E["<div class='flex items-center'><div class='i-carbon-user-avatar-filled-alt text-3xl mr-2'></div>Amazon Cognito</div>"] -->|Authenticates & Authorizes| B;
```

</div>

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 4) -> What about accessing data from a frontend, like a web or mobile app?
It's critical that you **never** put your AWS credentials directly in your frontend code. This is a major security risk.
The correct and secure architecture is to build an API layer that acts as an intermediary. This diagram shows the standard serverless pattern.
The user's application makes a request to an Amazon API Gateway endpoint.
API Gateway then triggers an AWS Lambda function.
This Lambda function contains the backend logic, like the Python code we just saw, to securely interact with DynamoDB.
To handle user authentication, you would use a service like Amazon Cognito, which can authorize users and ensure they only have permission to access their own data.

# Distribution & Optimization

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-6">
<div>

### Distribution
<!-- Mermaid diagram with styling handled by style.css -->
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Data Items
        A["Item 1<br><span class='description'>PK: user_A</span>"]
        B["Item 2<br><span class='description'>PK: user_B</span>"]
        C["Item 3<br><span class='description'>PK: user_C</span>"]
    end
    
    Hash["Hash(Partition Key)"]
    
    A --> Hash; B --> Hash; C --> Hash;
    
    subgraph "Partitions (Replicated)"
        P1[Partition 1]
        P2[Partition 2]
        P3[Partition 3]
    end
    
    Hash -- "user_A" --> P1; Hash -- "user_B" --> P3; Hash -- "user_C" --> P2;
```

</div>
<div>

### Optimization Best Practices
<v-clicks>

- **High-Cardinality Partition Key**: Choose a key with many unique values (like `user_id`, `order_id`) to prevent "hot partitions".
- **Use `Query` over `Scan`**: A `Query` operation is fast and efficient. A `Scan` reads the entire table and should be avoided in production.
- **Leverage Secondary Indexes**: Create Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) to enable efficient queries on non-key attributes.
- **Manage Capacity**: Use **On-Demand** for unpredictable workloads or **Provisioned** for predictable traffic to optimize costs.

</v-clicks>
</div>
</div>

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 5) -> So, how does DynamoDB achieve this scale and performance? It boils down to two things: distribution and optimization.
For distribution, DynamoDB uses partitioning. When you write an item, it takes the partition key and passes it through a hash function. This determines which physical partition the data is stored on.
This leads us to optimization. The most important best practice is to choose a partition key with many unique values to ensure your data is spread evenly. Always use the fast `Query` operation, and avoid the slow and expensive `Scan`. And finally, manage your costs by choosing the right capacity mode for your application's traffic pattern.

# Security & Integration

DynamoDB is secure by default and deeply integrated into the AWS ecosystem.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-6">
<div>

### Multi-Layered Security
<v-clicks>

- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**: Granular permissions for users and roles.
- **Encryption at Rest & In-Transit**: Data is automatically encrypted by default.
- **VPC Endpoints**: Keep traffic within your private AWS network.
- **CloudTrail Auditing**: Log all API calls for security and compliance.

</v-clicks>

</div>
<div>

### Seamless Integration
<!-- This diagram is now fixed. The faulty classDef is removed. -->
```mermaid
graph TD
    D["<div class='p-1'>DynamoDB</div>"]
    R("Amazon Redshift<br><span class='description'>Analytics</span>")
    S("Amazon OpenSearch<br><span class='description'>Full-Text Search</span>")
    L("AWS Lambda<br><span class='description'>Event-Driven Logic</span>")
    M("Other DBs<br><span class='description'>e.g., MongoDB</span>")

    D ---|Zero-ETL| R; D ---|Zero-ETL| S;
    D -- "Streams" --> L; M -- "AWS DMS" --> D;
    
    class D dynamodb-node;
```
</div>
</div>

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(Presenter 5) -> Security is built-in at every layer. Access is controlled by IAM, which allows you to define exactly who can do what. All data is encrypted both at rest on AWS servers and in-transit over the network. And all activity is logged for auditing.
Beyond security, DynamoDB's power is amplified by its integration with other AWS services.
A key feature is **Zero-ETL integrations**. This allows you to automatically replicate your DynamoDB data into services like Amazon Redshift for data analytics or OpenSearch for full-text search, without writing any complex data pipeline code.
For custom integrations, you can use DynamoDB Streams to trigger Lambda functions, or use the AWS Database Migration Service to move data between DynamoDB and other databases.

<!--
PRESENTER NOTES:
(William) -> To wrap things up, here are our key takeaways.
First, DynamoDB is a powerful, serverless database that's built for scale. If you're building a large-scale application and want to minimize operational work, it's an excellent choice.
Second, to use it effectively, you have to think differently than you would with a relational database. Your data model, especially your primary key, is the most important decision you'll make. Design for your access patterns.
And finally, DynamoDB doesn't exist in a vacuum. Its deep integration with the rest of the AWS ecosystem is what makes it a true pillar of modern cloud applications.
